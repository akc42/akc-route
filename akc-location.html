`akc-location`
A distributed router inspired by PolymerElements/app-route
Unfortunately There are design decisions that I am finding means it makes it too complicated
to use.  This is my attempt to provide equivalent functionality but in a slightly different way.

`akc-location` is the element that provides the interface with the browser address bar, converting
this to and from a `route` object that can be passed fown a chain of such object and consumed by
`akc-route`
